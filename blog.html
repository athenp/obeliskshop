            <h5><strong>The United States Tech Sector: <br>Data, Corpocracy and the Proliferation of the Spectacle</strong></h5>
            <h6>> Introduction</h6>
            <p>
            This article serves to paint an introductory picture of the United States as a technologically dystopian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_capitalism" target="_blank">late stage capitalist society</a>, relying on the continued <a href="https://hyperallergic.com/313435/an-illustrated-guide-to-guy-debords-the-society-of-the-spectacle/" target="_blank">Debordian spectacular projection</a> of technological innovation to prop up a hollow data-driven <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporatocracy" target="_blank">corpocracy</a> that draws its lifeblood from the exploitation of the working class. This analysis will be heavily based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_materialism" target="_blank">Marxist historical materialism</a> as applied to the bad-faith policy changes enacted between the beginning of the Nixon administration and the present day, ultimately drawing a parallel between the development of technology and the consolodation of power (as they both relate to increasing wealth inequality.)
            </p>
            <h6>> A Brief History of Government-Sanctioned Inequality</h6>
            <p>
            In order to contextualize the development of big tech it is important to recognize the policies and practices that led to the formation of these megaconglomerates. Although it is possible to follow this thread from the beginning of the industrial revolution, this article -- as stated in the introduction -- will focus on the period between the Nixon presidency and the current day (1970-2019) which saw the greatest and most deliberate increase in the concentration of wealth. <br>
            <ul type="circle">
            <strong>1970s</strong>
                <li>Congress created a new bankruptcy law that favored the wealthy over the middle and lower classes.</li>
                <li>The Supreme Court ruled that corporations have a First Amendment right to spend money on state ballot initiatives.</li>
            <strong>1980s</strong>
                <li>The Reagan presidency allowed corporations to replace pension plans with 401(k) plans, thus greatly reducing the retirement incomes of millions of middle and lower class workers.</li>
            <strong>1990s</strong>
                <li>The government allowed the growing use of stock options to dramatically increase CEO compensation.</li>
                <li>The government allowed “forced arbitration” clauses to exist in cable, cell phone, and other consumer contracts, which prevented consumers from participating in class action lawsuits when they felt that companies were unjustly taking small amounts of money each month from them and millions of other consumers.</li>
            <strong>2000s</strong>
                <li>The business community helped President George W. Bush pass his tax cuts for the rich.</li>
                <li>Congress and the president allowed U.S. companies to transform themselves into global corporations and move high tech jobs to foreign countries.</li>
                <li>Congress allowed employers to steal billions of dollars from employees through legalized wage theft.</li>
                <li>Congress allowed the business community to block attempts to “cap” excessive CEO compensation.</li>
                <li>The Supreme Court allowed corporations for the first time full rights to spend money as they wish in candidate elections -- federal, state and local.</li>
            </ul>
            <h6>> Open Source vs. Proprietary</h6>
            <p>
            During this substantial shift in the American political and corporate landscape there was another development occuring in the newly minted technological sector. The 1970s saw a split in programmers' opinions surrounding the future of software distribution. On one side of the spectrum, the proliferation of hacker culture and academia ultimately led to the philosophy that underpins the "free software movement". Proponents of this movement argue that software should be freely distributed in the public domain, not privately owned by for-profit corporations. On the other side were the capitalists, who wanted to control and monetize the flow of code. Unfortunately, by this time the American profit motive had already been cemented (largely by the policies outlined in the previous section.) Industry, having recognized the value of software as a commodity, used their combined resources to all but nullify the efforts of grassroots free software activists. By the mid 1980s software giants like Microsoft had built empires based on their ability to legally protect the code written by their employees.
            <br><br>
            This allowed the opportunity for corporations to yet again subjugate the American working class. Tech giants essentially took ownership of their employees' own collective innovations and sold it back to them, all while paying them a fraction of their own economic output (and stealing the rest.) Meanwhile, demand was rising for technological consumer goods and both extensive and intensive growth soared above individual compensation (extensive being growth as a result of an increase of capital and intensive being growth as a result of individual worker productivity). We were becoming a technology obsessed society, and tech companies seized this opportunity to shoehorn themselves into the forefront of our global consciousness.
            </p>
            <h6>> Stagnating Innovation</h6>
            <p>
                A third thread also formed during the time period being discussed, this time related to productivity. While demand for goods increased and technology promoted the development of a much larger and more rapid cycle of consumerism, the rate of actual intensive development was decreasing. From 1970 to 2010, the yearly rate of economic output per person fell from 3% to 1%.
                <br><br>
                In fact, this can be more generally applied to innovation. As noted by <i>The Economist</i>, despite a handful of great advances and improvements on existing technology, our day-to-day lives remain largely unchanged since 1980. Research and development have taken the biggest hits, contributing 7 times less than they did in 1970. Since technology relies on adapting development in the private sector, this has predictably taken a toll on our ability to produce things of value. Opponents may argue that there is more "innovation" than ever due to the deliberate projection of such an observation by the aforementioned cycle of consumerism, but in reality these developments actually "contribute" less and less to society. They are simply not impactful.
            </p>
            <h6>> Thread.join()</h6>
            <p>
            Now we've discussed these three important threads, but how do they all fit together? Well I think it's important to start with big tech's quest to privatize every aspect of not just the means of production -- which has been lamented ad-nauseam by Marxist scholars -- but also the free distribution of media, culture, and ideas. I think this quote best summarizes the imperative threat to innovation privatization poses:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                "Again, it is the existence of private ownership, not only over the material means of production, but also over the ideas and knowledge generated by society (i.e. patents and intellectual property), that is stifling the actual development and implementation of technology. Rather than co-operating and sharing knowledge to produce the best phone possible, companies such as Apple and Samsung instead embroil themselves in an endless series of legal cases over the infringement of various patents. Rather than investing in education and applying the most modern techniques in the advanced industrial countries, the capitalists instead take advantage of the abundant supply of cheap labour in Asia and elsewhere; or simply choose to speculate parasitically in the financial markets. And rather than employing the most advanced production techniques, such as 3D printers, which have the potential to provide another industrial revolution, such technologies are held back for fear of exacerbating the already existing excess capacity..."
            </blockquote>
            <p>
            One can further understand this threat by observing the 50 year history of rapidly reducing government regulation of industry, influenced by the simultaneous and equally rapid increase of corporate influence in politics. We've reached a point where companies get to decide not only which laws they are required to abide by, but they also get to dictate which laws govern the rest of the population (with the added guarantee of continued multinational accumulation of wealth.)
            </p>
            <h6>> The Spectacle: Data Replaces Capital</h6>
            <p>
            In the face of the self-imposed productivity and innovation barrier, how do tech companies continue to deceive the public into believing exactly the opposite is occurring? They simply change their business model. No longer do any of the leaders in the tech sector attempt to sell products solely based on a perceived objective advantage over their predecessors or competitors. Instead, they run carefully crafted marketing campaigns intended to sell abstract concepts such as a "status", a "story" or a "lifestyle".
            <br><br>
            As Debord predicted in his seminal work <i>Society of the Spectacle</i>, the modern era is defined not by the consumption of objects, but by the consumption of the <i>image</i> of these objects. The beauty of these images (or virtual objects) is that they can be endlessly fragmented and resold, at no detriment to the production of the original object.
            <br><br>
            Companies have capitalized on the power of The Spectacle through data. It is no stretch to say data is the most powerful commodity ever harnessed because data (just like the Debordian image) can be infinitely fragmented and manipulated into different commodities. In fact, the flow of data now contributes more to world GDP than the flow of physical goods -- data is no less than the lifeblood of capitalism. The global circulation of data, then, has now <i>become</i> the global circulation of capital.
            <br><br>
            This begs the question: is data regulated? Well, the answer would have been a lot closer to yes before tech companies became the progenitors of this new economic shift. Because of their heavy influence in global politics, efforts are underway to completely remove data from the hands of those who produce it (the people,) and instead transfer it to those who are best able to harness it. What does this mean? It means that companies can further embroil us in the trappings of the cycle of consumption and the web of the spectacle through targeted propaganda, all while increasing their stranglehold on the global supply of wealth and destroying the planet. What can we do about it? There are no concrete solutions, but organize locally for your right to information privacy and campaign for candidates that seek to limit the power of large corporations and the one percent.
